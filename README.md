I've always been curious about whether steroids really led to better hitting during the steroid era in baseball. Specifically, I wanted to explore how much performance-enhancing drugs, particularly from 1994 to 2004, boosted key hitting stats compared to modern baseball (2013-2023). While power hitting and home runs surged during the steroid era, I was able to understand if steroids were a major factor or if other variables played a role.
